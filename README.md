This is the bot that runs [Aviation chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/12036/aviation) - for more info, ping [@DannyBeckett](http://aviation.stackexchange.com/users/97/danny-beckett).

I've deleted [some commands](https://github.com/dannybeckett/SO-ChatBot/commits/master) that were specific to programming, or just unnecessary.

Ping me with ideas for new commands! Here are some that have been suggested:

- Aerodrome data - airnav or worldaerodata.com
- [Weather frequencies & phone numbers](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/weather/asos/)
